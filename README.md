# Hack-A-Thing2

For this Hack-A-Thing my goal was to create a proof of concept that multiplayer could be implemented in Unity. To this end, I create a little game demo that has ships shooting at enemies with one host and multiple clients. It gives our group a pretty clear way to proceed if we choose to go down the Unity route. I learned that multiplayer is functional in Unity but it is somewhat outdated. Other platforms might work better, but Unity is the industry standard so it might be the best choice to proceed. The other thing I learned and also didn't really work was that cameras are quite difficult with multiple clients. We are going to have to put a lot of work into having a different camera for each player while still being able to focus on the player's immediate surroundings; we simply can't have all the players able to see the whole screen or the same perspective.
